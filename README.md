# Welcome to RStudio

RStudio is an interpretive coding language, which means that it takes human inputted letters, words, numbers, etc. in a specific form of syntax to allows users to "talk" to the computer and ask it to perform a wide variety of computations (without having to speak like a computer thankfully).

As an interpretive language, RStudio also has a huge universe of pre-built functions that allow us to perform much more complicated commands in a simpler and more efficient way. To access these functions, RStudio uses *packages*.

Generally, we always want to begin any RStudio script by doing two things: setting the working directory, and loading the packages that we plan on using. Setting the working directory is our way of letting RStudio know where its homebase on our computer is so that is knows how to look around and find any files that we might want it to access. We can figure out where we currently are with the **getwd()** command and we can set a new location with the **setwd()** command
